# LAfNA â€“ linear algebra for numerical analysis

is a kickstart project for my mathematical journey diving deep into numerical algorithms and their complex implementations to use further in modeling and graphics programming.

---

**The goal** is to provide comprehensive library to use on Rust and C++ using FFI interface to access the modern algorithmic approach in Tensor operations.

WORK IN PROGRESS. NOW CONTAINS LITTLE TO NO REAL ALGORITHMS AND FUNCTIONALITY. WAIT FOR COMMITS SOON.
